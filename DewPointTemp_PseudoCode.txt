# 1. Mapper Function: Takes in a line from data and yields date and corresponding dew point temperatures.
BEGIN
    input line from data
    extract date
    extract dew point temperature
    yield date and wind dew point temperature
END

# 2. Reducer Function: Takes in the date and dew point temperature and returns the mean and variance of the dew point temperatures for the corresponding date.
BEGIN
    input date
    input list of dew point temperatures
    compute mean of dew point temperatures
    compute variance of dew point temperatures
    yield date and mean and variance of dew point temperatures
