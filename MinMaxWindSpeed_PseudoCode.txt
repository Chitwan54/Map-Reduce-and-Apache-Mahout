# 1. Mapper Function: Takes in a line from data and yields date and corresponding wind speed
BEGIN
    input line from data
    extract date
    extract wind speed
    yield date and wind speed
END

# 2. Reducer Function: Takes in the date and wind speed and returns the difference of maximum and minimum wind speed for that date.
BEGIN
    input date and wind speed
    find max wind speed
    find min wind speed
    compute difference b/w max and min wind speed
    yield date and difference
END
