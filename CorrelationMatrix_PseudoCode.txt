# 1. pearson_correlation: Takes in 2 variables and returns the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for the 2 variables.
BEGIN
    input variable 1
    input variable 2
    compute the Pearson Correlation Coefficient
    return the Pearson Correlation Coefficient
END

# 2. Mapper Function: Takes in a line from data and yields month, relative humidity, wind speed and dry bulb temperature.
BEGIN
    input line from data
    extract month
    extract relative humidity
    extract wind speed
    extract dry bulb temperature
    yield date, relative humidity, wind speed and dry bulb temperature.
END

# 3. Reducer Function: Takes in the month and the weather data and returns the correlation matrix of the weather data for the corresponding month.
BEGIN
    input month
    input weather data
    initialise a 3X3 correlation matrix with all values 0
    for all variables in weather data:
        for all variables in weather data:
            compute pearson correlation coefficient
            update the current position of the correlation matrix with the coefficient
    yield month, correlation matrix
