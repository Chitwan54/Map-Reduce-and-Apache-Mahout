# 1. Mapper Function: Takes in a line from data and yields date and corresponding relative humidity.
BEGIN
    input line from data
    extract date
    extract relative humidity
    yield date and wind relative humidity
END

# 2. Reducer Function: Takes in the date and relative humidity and returns the min relative humidity for the corresponding date.
BEGIN
    input date
    input list of relative humidity
    compute min of relative humidity
    yield date and min of relative humidity
END
